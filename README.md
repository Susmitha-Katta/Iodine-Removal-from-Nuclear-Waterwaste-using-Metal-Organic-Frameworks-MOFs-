## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

This repository contains datasets used in the research on "Predicting Iodine Removal from Nuclear Wastewater Using Machine Learning Models on Metalâ€“Organic Frameworks (MOFs)".

Each file is structured to support different preprocessing and feature engineering strategies.

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `Features_in_Iodine_Adsorption.csv` | ðŸ§ª List of features (descriptors) used for modeling, including structural, chemical, and topological properties of MOFs. |
| `Augmented_Iodine_Adsorption.csv` | ðŸ“ˆ Augmented dataset that combines experimental and synthesized data for iodine adsorption capacity. Enhances the training process with more diverse samples. |
| **`MOF_mean.csv`** | ðŸ§® Dataset with missing values imputed using mean of each feature column. Useful for symmetric distributions. |
| **`MOF_median.csv`** | ðŸ§® Dataset with missing values imputed using median of each feature. Ideal for handling skewed distributions. |
| **`MOF_mode.csv`** | ðŸ§® Dataset with missing values imputed using mode (most frequent value). Best suited for categorical data. |
